# Getting Started

If running the website on your local machine, you will need to clone the git files and run a yarn install in both the main folder as well as the client folder. Once completed, you will need to set up a Mongo database with the name "comments", and a collection named "comments", and run mongod in Terminal in order to utilize the forum page. You can then run yarn start from the main file folder in Terminal to launch the program. You can visit the working site at https://agile-springs-18554.herokuapp.com/
